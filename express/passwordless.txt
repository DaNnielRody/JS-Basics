Passwordless:
With passwordless authentication, the user does not need login credentials, but rather, they gain access to the system by demonstrating they possess a factor that proves their identity. Common factors include biometrics such as a fingerprint, a "magic link" sent to their email address, or a one-time passcode sent to a mobile device. Password recovery systems now commonly use passwordless authentication.

Passwordless authentication is achieved using Public Key and Private Key Encryption. In this method, when a user registers for the app, the user's device generates a private key/public key pair that utilizes a factor that proves their identity, as noted above.

The public key is used to encrypt messages, and the private key is used to decrypt them. The private key is stored on the user's device, and the public key is stored with the application and registered with a registration service.

Anyone may access the public key, but the private key is only known to the client. When the user signs into the application, the application generates a login challenge, such as requesting biometrics, sending a "magic link," or sending a special code via SMS, encrypting it with the public key. The private key allows the message to be decrypted. The app then verifies the sign-in challenge and accepts the response to authorize the user.
